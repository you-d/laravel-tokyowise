Status : Discontinued 
Reason : Outdated PHP Framework (Laravel 4.2)

###### Introduction : 

Inspired by the attractiveness, and clean plus unique 3-columns design of the site's homepage, I decided to recreate this website by utilising the Laravel 4.2 PHP Framework - a superb web development framework by Taylor Otwell that has gained a huge popularity among web dev communities in recent years. This exceptional framework truly allows developers to focus on implementing business logic by providing high level abstractions of common web development patterns, and plenty of convenient helpers to minimise the boring and repetitive tasks in a typical web development project.  Moreover, I was also intrigued by the responsive capability of the site that is achieved without relying on any 3rd party libraries such as Twitter Bootstrap. 

However, This project is not merely a clone of the real website. For obvious reason I don't have access towards the back end of the real website. Hence, I took a liberty to design & develop the backend side plus a CMS to manage the content of this demo site. 

As of the current stage, this project is far from being production ready even though it is already taking shape. A few minor pages are still unfinished, heaps of measures could still be implemented to improve the site's backend  performance, etc etc...
